# Fibonacci Grid

## Version

Made with Unity 2021.1.15f1

## Instructions
Use the options to customize the interactions with the Grid.
* **Only Classic Fibonacci**: Will ignore sequences that would result in c=a+b but are not part of the "golden sequence", such as 4,4,8,12,20...
* **Decrement with (Mouse Right)**: The right button of the mouse will decrement the column/lines while using the left button will still always increment them.
* **Min. Consec. Sequence**: Customize (from 5 to 10) how the necessary sequence to clear all cells.
* **Grid Size (X,Y)**: Change the Grid size and create a new one.

The initial options are the ones supposed to be the default.
